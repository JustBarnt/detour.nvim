# Never lose your spot!üìçüó∫Ô∏è
`detour.nvim` provides the `:Detour` command that opens a popup window that you can use as you would a split window.

Popups are better than splits during those times when you want to take a detour into some other files without losing your place in the current file. They also allow you to use the entire screen whereas a split would not.

# Installation

## Lazy.nvim

```lua
{ "carbon-steel/detour.nvim",
    config = function ()
       vim.keymap.set('n', '<c-w><enter>', ":Detour<cr>")
   end
},
```

# Recipes
`detour.nvim` is capable of more than just reading files. It generalizes the floating window behavior of plugins such as toggleterm.nvim or lazygit.nvim. `detour.nvim` can wrap any TUI in a floating window. Its applications don't stop at just TUIs. Here are some examples:

```lua
-- Wrap any TUI inside a detour popup
vim.keymap.set("n", '<leader>p', function ()
    require('detour').Detour() -- open a detour popup
    vim.cmd.terminal() -- open a terminal buffer
    vim.bo.bufhidden = 'delete' -- close the terminal when window closes
    -- Run the `top` command
    local text = vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes("atop<CR>", true, false, true)
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(text, "n", false)
end)

-- A keymap for opening a prompt to select a terminal buffer to open in a popup
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>t', function()
    require('detour').Detour() -- Open a detour popup
    vim.cmd.enew() -- Swith to a blank buffer to prevent any accidental changes
    require('telescope.builtin').buffers({}) -- Open telescope prompt
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys("term", "n", true) -- popuplate prompt with "term"
end)
```

# FAQ
> I want to convert popups to splits or tabs.

`<C-w>s` and `<C-w>v` can be used from within a popup to create splits. `<C-w>T` creates tabs.

> My LSP keeps moving my cursor to other windows.

If your LSP movements (ex: `go-to-definition`) are opening locations in other windows, make sure that you're not calling these movements with the `reuse_win` set to `true`.

> My popups don't look good.

Some colorschemes don't have visually clear floating window border colors. Consider customizing your colorscheme's FloatBorder to a color that makes your popups clearer.
