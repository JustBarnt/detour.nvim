> It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

The programming process always includes interruptions where we stop writing code and go read some other code. This Neovim plugin helps us find our way back from these detours.

(Neo)Vim users often encapsulate detours in a split or a tab. However,
* splits keep you from using most of your screen
* We're not always good about cleaning up splits/tabs (cluttering up your workspace)

What if we used a popup window instead?
