> It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

The programming process always includes interruptions where we stop writing code and go read some other code. These detours often come from `go-to-definition`/`declaration`/`class`/`references` but may also come from other reasons. These detours can branch into other detours and can make finding our way back to the start frustrating.

One common way to reduce the frustrations of detours is to encapsulate the detour in a split or a tab. However,
* splits keep you from using most of your screen
* Most users are not good about cleaning up splits and tabs after they're done (accumulating clutter in your workspace)

What if we used a popup window instead?

TODO: show a gif of promoting a popup to a split, vsplit, and a tab
